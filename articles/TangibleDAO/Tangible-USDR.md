# A TL;DR of our Findings



* Tangible is building an on-ramp and trading platform for real-world assets (RWAs). Physical items such as gold bars, watches, or real estate (RE) are tokenized (i.e. minted) as tangible non-fungible tokens (TNFTs).
* The protocol provides a marketplace to issue and trade TNFTs. The legal entity behind the project (Tangible Labs) facilitates the real-world purchase and custody of these goods. It collaborates with several service providers (vendors, custody) across different jurisdictions. However, most of its business is centered around the UK.
* In the case of real estate, Tangible creates SPV (special purpose vehicles) to acquire and manage the properties. These are legal entities specifically established for this purpose. They already have listed over 14 properties in the UK.
* The protocol’s token $TNGBL is used to incentivize the usage of Tangible’s products, and it provides a revenue share to those locking the token. In return, stakers receive so-called 3,3+ NFTs that represent their positions. TNGBL is not a governance token (yet).
* Tangible also issues a stablecoin - Real USD (USDR). It is pegged to the US Dollar and over-collateralized with RE TNFTs, DAI, and other assets. USDR comes with intrinsic yield, generated by the RE TNFTs, which is forwarded to its holders via daily rebases. Currently, the yield sits at ~8% with an additional 10% subsidized through TNGBL airdrops.
* The stablecoin is natively issued on Polygon, where it currently has 159 [holders](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xb5dfabd7ff7f83bab83995e72a52b97abb7bcf63#balances). However, USDR is not a completely trustless or decentralized stablecoin. It relies on the protocol's own RWA on-ramp service and management by the team.
* If compared to other stablecoins, USDR would probably fit somewhere between USDC and FRAX. It is built to be backed by RWA collateral, it relies on centralized processes (RE on-ramp) and real-world custody but applies elements of hybrid algo-stablecoins (automated collateral management and TNGBL as collateral).
* Using RE as collateral comes with some benefits but also risks. While its yield and price stability are very attractive, its price finding and liquidation can pose an issue. The current setup can also lead to a conflict of interest, as Tangible is the only issuer of the collateral that is backing its own stablecoin.
* The project is very ambitious and multi-faceted. It combines elements of DeFi and RWA tokenization to create a novel solution. However, it appears to be quite complex also on a technical level, introducing many centralized components and potential single points of failure. In conclusion, the project would not count as “battle-tested” and it is fully dependent on the founding team. Governance is not live yet. Decision-making, custody, and development are still centralized and thus rather risky.


# Introduction - TangibleDAO

Tangible is a [marketplace](https://www.tangible.store/) for tokenized assets, a stablecoin issuer, and an on/off-ramp service for real-world assets (RWAs). Tangible’s marketplace enables the primary purchase and secondary trading of tokenized physical goods, such as wine, real estate, watches, or gold bars. When purchasing a good through Tangible, the buyer receives the product in the form of a TNFT - a tangible non-fungible token - which is minted upon purchase. These TNFTs represent ownership of the physical item.

The real item is acquired through one of Tangible's partner vendors, and stored in one of their storage facilities. Each product type requires individual storage facilities. A storage fee is charged to the owner of the TNFT. For example, the fee for storing gold bars is 1% per year.

In case of redemption, Tangible collaborates with logistic firms to ensure the safe shipping of physical goods. Shipping fees must be paid by the person redeeming the TNFT and are calculated on an individual basis.

In summary, Tangible allows the conversion of real-world assets into TNFTs, which can be redeemed for the real physical product. Their [docs](https://docs.tangible.store/) provide an overview of the process to explain how it works (see image below).


![marketplace-process](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/bcd1e3e47bc3345a8418e237dd48ace67a7f768e/articles/TangibleDAO/images/tangible-docs-marketplace-process.png)


(Source: [Tangible Docs](https://docs.tangible.store/))



1. A user buys an item on Tangible’s marketplace. Smart contracts process the item price and storage fee where relevant.
2. The TNFT is minted and sent to the user’s wallet.
3. Concurrently, Tangible completes the purchase of the physical item through its partner supplier.
4. The purchased item is shipped to a Tangible Vault for storage.

In addition, besides minting new TNFTs through the primary store, Tangible also built a marketplace for secondary trading. Thus facilitating the buying and selling of existing TNFTs. In this scenario, the buyer sends USDR and in return, the TNFT is transferred to their wallet. Tangible applies a 2.5% marketplace fee per trade. 33.3% of the fee is used to buy and burn TNGBL tokens, and the remaining 66.6% is distributed to TNGBL stakers (3,3+ NFT holders).

However, secondary market sales can be an issue for sellers who need liquidity immediately. The current system requires users to wait until a buyer is willing to pay for the goods. The team is working on a solution that should enable faster liquidations (not live yet).


## Product Categories

Four tokenized product [categories](https://docs.tangible.store/product-categories) are live on the platform. These are Gold, Wine, Watches, and Real Estate. For each category, Tangible is working with international suppliers.

For the trading and storing of gold bars, Tangible uses the service of [PX Precinox](https://pxgroup.com/en/companies/px-precinox/) in Switzerland. For wines, they collaborate with London-based [Bordeaux Index](https://bordeauxindex.com/), and for watches, they work with UK-based [BQ Watches](https://www.bqwatches.com/).

In the case of real estate, Tangible creates local Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV). These are legal entities established for every property. For instance, each UK-based property has its own [UK-SPV](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/advanced-search/get-results?companyNameIncludes=TNFT&companyNameExcludes=&registeredOfficeAddress=&incorporationFromDay=&incorporationFromMonth=&incorporationFromYear=&incorporationToDay=&incorporationToMonth=&incorporationToYear=&sicCodes=&dissolvedFromDay=&dissolvedFromMonth=&dissolvedFromYear=&dissolvedToDay=&dissolvedToMonth=&dissolvedToYear=). This is done because real estate cannot be directly tokenized. However, legal entities can. Real estate TNFT holders get beneficial ownership over the SPV, which holds beneficial ownership over the property. Legal ownership of both, however, remains with Tangible’s legal entity (i.e. [BTS TNFT Limited](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13591056), incorporated in the UK, Tangible also has an entity registered in the British Virgin Islands with the same name).

In addition, SPVs also manage the property. For example, sourcing tenants, collecting rent, or managing repairs. All properties are leased out and rental yield is paid to the TNFT holder(s) in USDC.


## Fractional TNFTs

Tangible Fractions are smaller fractions of a whole TNFT. This allows large ticket items (e.g. real estate) to be split into more affordable pieces. This way multiple owners can share the risks and rewards of an investment. To create fractionalized TNFTs, the complete TNFT is locked into a [smart contract vault](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x44100ed95c83ee1a669742dca58f9461fd8f9a78#code), that splits it into several Fractional TNFTs. The original TNFT can only be redeemed by collecting all the individual fractions.


## TNGBL Token

Tangible’s token [$TNGBL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tangible) has three main functions. It serves as a reward token (to incentivize usage of the marketplace and subsidize USDR yield), it has a revenue-sharing mechanism (to incentivize lock-ups of TNGBL), and lastly, it functions as a backing for USDR (i.e. it can be used to mint USDR). It does not have any governing rights so far.

The max supply of [TNGBL](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x49e6a20f1bbdfeec2a8222e052000bbb14ee6007) is capped at 33M. The initial [distribution](https://docs.tangible.store/tangible-token-tngbl) foresees a majority allocation to the DAO and the community (70.8%). The rest is mostly reserved for the team, investors, advisors, and Tangible Labs. Another 1.25% were sold in an [IDO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS4C7440fjw) in April 2022 via [PeakDeFi](https://launchpad.peakdefi.com/). However, there is no distribution schedule or any information provided on how the “DAO share” will enter circulation.

While officially capped at 33M, more TNGBL could theoretically be minted. An evaluation of the token contract via [GoPlusLabs](https://gopluslabs.io/token-security/137/0x49e6A20f1BBdfEeC2a8222E052000BbB14EE6007) reveals that:



* **Change Balance** - The contract owner has the authority to modify the balance of tokens at other addresses, which may result in a loss of assets.
* **Mint Function** - The contract may contain additional issuance functions, which can generate more tokens.
* **Hidden Owner** - The token has a hidden owner address. Meaning that developers can potentially still manipulate the contract even if ownership has been abandoned.

![Polyscan-Erc20-sol-file](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/polyscan-tangibleerc20-sol-file-highlighted.png)


(Source: [TangibleERC20.sol](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x05d71db24f436e40d4bcb54724dc458eb641c2f1#code))

As mentioned, TNGBL holders can earn a share of the platform's revenue by locking up their tokens. The longer the lock-up period, the higher the reward multiplier. The multiplier rewards stakers with additional TNGBL tokens. When locking TNGBL, users receive a so-called 3,3+ NFT in return, which represents the locked position. The maximum lock-up period is four years. In comparison to other established ve-tokenomics designs, however, Tangible’s 3,3+ NFTs do not grant lockers any governance rights or influence over a reward gauge. In the absence of long-term governance alignment, the use of locking tokens is questionable.

Tangible also built a [marketplace](https://www.tangible.store/explore?category=3%2C3%2B+NFTs&page=1&sorting=%7B%7D&filters=%7B%7D) for 3,3+ NFTs, to allow users an early exit without having to unlock TNGBL, which would result in a reduced reward. However, given that the max lockup amount for TNGBL tokens is already reached, locking TNGBL does not come with a multiplier anymore.

While 33.3% of the marketplace fees are used to buy back and burn TNGBL. The remaining 66.6% can be claimed by 3,3+ NFT holders. The reward is issued in USDR and depends on the amount of locked TNGBL and the multiplier.

3,3+ NFTs were also handed out as a reward to early users of the platform. For instance, by purchasing a gold bar and minting a gold TNFT, users were rewarded with a 3,3+ NFT. This incentivization is no longer active though. And finally, the token also serves as collateral for USDR (more on that later).

At the time of writing, there are only 21 TNGBL token holders on [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x05d71db24f436e40d4bcb54724dc458eb641c2f1#balances). The largest holder, however, is the [PassiveIncomeNFT](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xdc7ee66c43f35ac8c1d12df90e61f05fbc2cd2c1#code) contract. It holds 98.75% of all TNGBL tokens. This means that almost the entire circulating supply is locked in 3,3+ NFTs. There are currently 1347 [addresses](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd71b43474da7f77a567925f107f5fa611a22cb40#balances) holding these 3,3+ Passive Income (PI) NFTs. The largest one is the [Tangible:Deployer](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd71b43474da7f77a567925f107f5fa611a22cb40?a=0x3d41487a3c5662ede90d0ee8854f3cc59e8d66ad) contract with 78%, which is an EOA.


# Real USD - Introduction

Real USD (USDR) is a natively **rebasing**, **yield-bearing**, **over-collateralized stablecoin**, **pegged to the US dollar**. [USDR](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xb5dfabd7ff7f83bab83995e72a52b97abb7bcf63?a=0xa138341185a9d0429b0021a11fb717b225e13e1f#readContract) is issued on Polygon where it currently counts 142 holders. The stablecoin is backed by ERC-20s, LP tokens, and tokenized real estate. USDR is issued by Tangible, and partially backed by tokenized real estate (RE) TNFTs. Using real estate TNFTs as collateral enables two novel features:



1. **Intrinsic Yield** - According to Tangible, their properties yield 8-10% annual interest from rentals. This yield is paid out to USDR holders in the form of daily rebases (i.e. the amount of USDR in a wallet automatically increases). To boost yield for early adopters, Tangible is currently subsidizing USDR via a daily airdrop of TNGBL to USDR holders, thus increasing the yield by ~10%.
2. **Exposure to a novel asset class** - Stablecoins are usually backed by either highly volatile crypto assets or other stablecoins. Real estate on the other hand has a long [track record](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/average-house-prices#:~:text=Average%20House%20Prices%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20averaged%20128122.75%20GBP,United%20Kingdom%20Average%20House%20Prices.) of relatively low volatility and continuous appreciation in value. In other words, the value of the collateral backing USDR should steadily increase.

The drawback of these TNFTs is the general illiquidity that comes with the real estate market. Unlike currencies or securities, properties cannot be sold within minutes. Especially when tokenized on-chain. But real estate can still depreciate in value. Therefore, a good liquidation mechanism and measures to keep USDR over-collateralized are needed. Tangible has a few methods for keeping the collateralization ratio (CR) over 100%. These are:



* In case the CR of USDR falls below 100%, half of the rental yield payments are retained by the USDR collateral treasury. The daily rebase is consequently reduced by 50%. In other words, USDR holders earn less interest, until the CR is back to 100%.
* The treasury that is backing USDR always holds other more liquid assets for fast liquidations (e.g. DAI, protocol-owned liquidity, and TNGBL tokens).
* In case all DAI and other reserves are emptied, real estate TNFTs are liquidated. In such a scenario, users will receive[ pDAI](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x263fa8f30351472A1363902318098bEfAD3B440e) instead of real DAI. pDAI serves as an IOU token that represents a claim to real DAI, once the liquidation is executed.
* A benefit of real-estate-based yield is that it’s not highly correlated with the asset’s price volatility. Rents don’t change in the short to mid-term. Even if the properties’ value decreases (and thus the CR), the monthly income remains.


## **Minting Real USD**

USDR can be minted using TNGBL or DAI at a 1:1 ratio. To access the minting function, users can visit Tangible's [website](https://www.tangible.store/realusd). The USDR contracts are deployed on Polygon and are based on Open Zeppelin smart contracts.

When minting USDR, DAI or TNGBL tokens are sent to the [collateral vault](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6Ef682F0223687c625E6c4a115F544a80c37dA33#code) that is backing USDR. Tangible calls this contract the USDR treasury. However, there's a limit to how much USDR can be minted using TNGBL. According to the [docs](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/minting-real-usd), it cannot exceed 10% of the total USDR minted, minus USDR redeemed. This reduces the risk associated with TNGBL's volatility and prevents a potential death spiral event.

Tangible aims to also mint USDR from [system gains](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/minting-from-system-gains). This happens when the assets in the USDR treasury exceed a 100% collateralization ratio. In such cases, the system uses the gains to buy more real estate TNFTs by minting new USDR. For instance, if the price of TNGBL increases, new USDR is minted against this appreciation and used to buy TNFTs. This helps shift the collateralization from TNGBL to yield-bearing real estate.

The team also expresses the intention to fully [automate](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/backing/real-estate#tangibles-true-property-valuation-tpv) this process in the future. While the process indicates a willingness to maximize capital efficiency, the team has left a collateral buffer to reduce risk (more on that later).


## **Redeeming Real USD**

Real USD is redeemable 1:1 for DAI at any time. Using the redemption function will incur a 0.25% fee. According to [Tangible](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/redeeming-real-usd), this fee is configurable and will sit just above the fee of Curve, thus encouraging swaps over redemptions.

In the event that all DAI from the treasury is redeemed, users who wish to redeem USDR will receive [pDAI](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x263fa8f30351472A1363902318098bEfAD3B440e#code) (promissory DAI) - a synthetic IOU token that represents a claim to real DAI. The treasury will then start the liquidation process of its TNFTs. Users will be able to exchange pDAI 1:1 for DAI, once real estate TNFTs were sold for more DAI.

Tangible also has plans to leverage protocol-owned liquidity (POL). They already own most of the Curve [metapool](https://curve.fi/#/polygon/pools/factory-v2-339/deposit) (USDR-am3CRV). It thus makes sense to have a redemption fee that is higher than the Curve swap fee. So users are incentivized to swap USDR using the Curve metapool, instead of emptying the treasury.

In conclusion, the redemption of USDR is limited to the amount of DAI in its treasury. And by extension to the number of other stables in the Curve pool. However, this only counts for immediate redemptions. Users who are willing to wait, can rely on the TNFT liquidation mechanism, and receive pDAI instead of DAI.


## **USDR Collateral Structure**

As mentioned above, USDR is backed by different types of collateral. There are currently five categories, each with a flexible share. According to their [docs](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/backing), the collateral structure is targeted to look as shown in the image.

![usdr-collatera-structure](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/tangible-docs-collateral-backing.png)

(source: [TangibleDAO documentation](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/backing))

The planned collateral allocation generally falls within the projected share ranges. Notable differences are the share of real estate and TNGBL tokens.

The image below displays the current collateral structure. The share of real estate is only 38.6%. This section requires more growth to achieve 50-80%. The TNGBL’s share on the other hand is over 18%. A difference of plus 8% from the promised allocation. This is due to TNGBL's recent price appreciation, according to the team.

![tangible-website-collateral-ratio](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/tangible-website-collateral-ratio.png)


(source: [Tangible Website - USDR](https://www.tangible.store/realusd))

[Side note: The reported shares in the image correspond to the outstanding USDR ($11.3M). When compared to the overall collateral ($13.3M), however, real estate only accounts for 32.7%].

It’s also worth noting that the protocol-owned liquidity (POL) share of 24.9% contains over 54% of USDR. Having POL backing USDR is reasonable. It increases liquidity, creates a revenue stream for the treasury, and provides another venue to swap USDR (besides redemption). However, it is recommended to differentiate POL from the rest of the “intrinsic collateral” (e.g. DAI or TNFTs). As with AMOs, POL provides a separate issuance and redemption option for USDR. It should thus be labeled differently, for instance as “extrinsic collateral”. It’s also important for (retail) liquidity providers to understand that they participate in a Curve [pool](https://curve.fi/#/polygon/pools/factory-v2-339/deposit), which is used as a backstop mechanism for USDR redemption. On the other hand, Tangible currently owns [99.9%](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xa138341185a9d0429b0021a11fb717b225e13e1f#balances) of the Curve pool. Indicating that there is little organic demand to provide liquidity.


### Tokenized Real Estate as Collateral

Real Estate (RE) represents the main collateral type of USDR. As mentioned earlier, using RE has several advantages. It is natively yield-bearing, it comes with low price volatility, the yield is independent of the price, and it has a history of strong value appreciation.

Tangible plans to make real estate the main collateral. Up to 80% of USDR is going to be backed by RE. This leads to some key questions:



* How is the real value (market price) of RE defined?
* What method is used to value RE’s appraisal?
* Is 100% CR the optimal parameter for USDR, considering the risks that come with RE as the main type of collateral?
* Should USDR have a built-in risk management and liquidation system?
* How trustless is the RE on-ramp and liquidation process?
* How is the regulatory situation impacting tokenized RE?

It’s beyond the scope of this article to answer all these questions. However, it is clear that there are certain drawbacks to using RE as collateral. First of all, it complicates the calculation of the collateral’s value. It doesn’t come without effort to agree on the real value of these properties. Some websites offer the service of estimating the market price. For instance, [zoopla.co.uk](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/) is one option. Tangible recommends using [hometrack.com](https://www.hometrack.com/) to find housing prices. However, these are all just estimations, the real price is only determined once the property is sold. 

The second obstacle is the confirmation that the TNFT represents the promised SPV and that the SPV owns the property. It would be easy to just mint TNFTs without actually buying a house. Tangible therefore provides access to all the official documents for each property.

In summary, Tangible has to work with value estimates for its collateral. And the whole process is susceptible to centralized and trusted intermediaries that Tangible has to circumvent by increasing transparency.


### Proof of Ownership & Purchase - An Example

Tangible provides a list of all 14 [properties](https://www.tangible.store/realusd/properties) backing USDR. Let’s look at the example of the apartment in [Gillingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/X1+Chatham+Waters/@51.3995588,0.5448852,948m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m10!1m2!2m1!1slocation+Location+S1-08+Chatham+Waters,+South+House,+Gillingham+Gate+Rd,+Gillingham+ME4+4RS,+UK!3m6!1s0x47d8cd46e69990fd:0xaea3b218eca0d54c!8m2!3d51.3982314!4d0.5502304!15sCl9sb2NhdGlvbiBMb2NhdGlvbiBTMS0wOCBDaGF0aGFtIFdhdGVycywgU291dGggSG91c2UsIEdpbGxpbmdoYW0gR2F0ZSBSZCwgR2lsbGluZ2hhbSBNRTQgNFJTLCBVS1pdIltsb2NhdGlvbiBsb2NhdGlvbiBzMSAwOCBjaGF0aGFtIHdhdGVycyBzb3V0aCBob3VzZSBnaWxsaW5naGFtIGdhdGUgcmQgZ2lsbGluZ2hhbSBtZTQgNHJzIHVrkgESYXBhcnRtZW50X2J1aWxkaW5nmgEjQ2haRFNVaE5NRzluUzBWSlEwRm5TVU10TlRsaFprVm5FQUXgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11g0gfrrn5?authuser=0) (see the image below). This is one of the properties backing USDR. All relevant documents can be accessed via a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0) file share.


![tangible-website-appartment](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/tangible-website-re-appartment.png)

(Source: [Tangible Website](https://www.tangible.store/product/0x29613FbD3e695a669C647597CEFd60bA255cc1F8?tokenId=340282366920938463463374607431768211474))

According to the [list](https://www.tangible.store/realusd/properties) on the website, as well as on-chain records show that the corresponding TNFT is owned by the [USDR treasury](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x6Ef682F0223687c625E6c4a115F544a80c37dA33#tokentxnsErc721). The item is listed on [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0x29613fbd3e695a669c647597cefd60ba255cc1f8?a=340282366920938463463374607431768211474#inventory). It can be recognized by its ID number (340282366920938463463374607431768211474).

This, however, only completes the on-chain proof that the USDR treasury owns the corresponding TNFT. Tangible attached eight documents to the respective Dropbox share for proof of purchase. Among them is a [valuation report](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=Chatham+Waters+-Valuation+Report+-+Apt+99+3-bed.pdf), which attests the apartment's market price of £470k (~580k in USD). Further, there is a [sales agreement](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=Sales+Agreement+.pdf) providing the agreed-upon sales price, as well as a [completion statement](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=Completion+Statement+.pdf) confirming that the property was bought for £413k (incl. stamp tax and other fees). There is also a property management agreement ([PMA](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=PMA+Agreement+S1-08.pdf)) and an [insurance policy](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=Insurance+Policy.pdf).

Moreover, the file share entails a [certificate of incorporation](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=TNFT+Prop+12+Incorporation+.pdf) confirming the establishment of an SPV named TNFT PROP 12 LTD. This can also be confirmed by checking the official [company register](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/14716341) of the UK. A [transfer document](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cgzx9g4xk2av72s/AAD4IxvMie6z0n5bVP-tgEVWa?dl=0&preview=TR1+Transfer.pdf) confirms that the property at Chatham Waters, Gillingham was transferred to the respective LTD (SPV).

Assuming that all documents are correct, this completes the proof of ownership. According to Tangible’s [docs](https://docs.tangible.store/legal#who-owns-the-rights-to-the-physical-item), the legal ownership remains with the token issuer, which is Tangible. The beneficial ownership, however, is with the token holder. This setup is similar to Circle’s USDC.

In conclusion, the process of verifying the price and ownership of real estate is rather cumbersome and not scalable. Users of Tangible or USDR have to either trust the project or go through a verification process for each and every TNFT that is backing USDR. This process needs to be improved and better methods to increase transparency need to be found. Tangible mentions a collaboration with Chainlink, to directly feed market prices of its properties from an independent source. This, however, is not live yet and raised other questions (more on that in the next section).


# Risk Vectors


## Smart Contract Risk

The protocol already has over 60 unique smart contracts deployed ([list 1](https://docs.tangible.store/contracts-and-addresses) and [list 2](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/real-usd-contracts-and-addresses)). It has cross-chain implementations and many off-chain components that play an important role. The smart contracts related to USDR were audited by [CyberScope](https://github.com/cyberscope-io/audits/blob/main/tngbl/audit.pdf) over three phases:



1. Initial audit (Nov. 24, 2022)
2. Correction phase 1 (Dec. 15, 2022)
3. Correction phase 2 (Jan. 17, 2023)

[Side note: CyberScope’s audit report falsely mentions the release date as January 2022, instead of 2023. The team was notified and acknowledged the error]

The audit did not find any major bugs or high-severity issues. In total 19 issues were found (2 medium, 17 minor, and 0 critical). But it did surface several recommendations to improve the code or the architecture. Some examples are listed below:



1. **Administrator** **Configurations** - Many contracts depend on configurations from an administrator. For example, when it comes to funding allocation (e.g. bond program, affiliate, and incentive features) and direct state manipulation. In other words, the protocol depends on human interaction with its contracts, and there is no smart contract with an implemented business logic.
2. **Decimal Architecture** - The contracts do not have a single point of decimals normalization mechanism. One example from the audit is highlighted below:

![cyberscope-audit-report](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/cyberscope-audit-report-p13.png)

(source: [CyberScope audit](https://github.com/cyberscope-io/audits/blob/main/tngbl/audit.pdf))


3. **Random Architecture of Contracts Roles -** Every contract contains its own access layer. Several roles were used, for example, BURNER, MINTER, CONTROLLER, TRACKER, ROUTER_POLICY, etc.

    The auditors pointed out a possible conflict between administrator roles and general architecture (addresses, contracts). They recommended using multi-signature wallets as an additional layer of security.


Adding to the last point, there is a general concern around access rights. Our research found that almost every contract has some sort of admin access. Hence, none of the contracts are immutable. Despite the use of multi-sigs for most contracts, it opens a potential attack vector, given the high number of contracts and the use of a 2-of-3 multi-sig. Essentially, only two signers need to be compromised to endanger the whole project.

In conclusion, the audit did not find any severe issues. However, despite the audit's findings, the current setup urges caution. First of all, the recent Euler [exploit](https://rekt.news/euler-rekt/) shows that even six audits still do not prevent a hack. But more importantly, none of Tangible’s 60+ contracts are immutable, and many are relying on manual interaction (administrator role). These roles appear to be managed somewhat orderless. The sheer amount of contracts and the current setup create additional complexity. And essentially, this opens unnecessary risk vectors and is prone to human errors. Moreover, the contracts are susceptible to compromised access rights. Adding to these points are the facts that the project has no decentralized components (e.g. a governance module) and a bug bounty program is also missing.


## On-Chain Custody Risk

As mentioned above, the Tangible platform and the USDR smart contracts are based on admin role privileges and a few multi-signature wallets. The custody risk thus lies in the hands of these signers. They basically control the entire project, making it a fully centralized project.

Looking at the signers from the most relevant wallets leads to the conclusion that the same two to three EOAs control all wallets. A summary of all signers is listed below:



* [Tangible Labs](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xaf8a1548fd69a59ce6a2a5f308bcc4698e1db2e5) Multi-sig (2-of-3). This wallet has control over the USDR collateral treasury and minting of all TNFTs, including real estate:
    * [Signer 1](https://debank.com/profile/0x9f70ecf8cae680f0bde6c0b7bdaec348ef9be554) (460 days - high activity; ENS tag -> tangiblelabs.eth)
    * [Signer 2](https://debank.com/profile/0xff7afa1153c4d56756000b29ff534f309129ac26) (558 days - medium activity)
    * [Signer 3](https://debank.com/profile/0x6bd40c6f7849160fe217d07a73e15f4ef8222283) (428 days - low activity)
* [Tangible DAO](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x100fcc635acf0c22dcdcef49dd93ca94e55f0c71)** **Multi-sig** (**4-of-5):
    * [Signer 1](https://debank.com/profile/0x9f70ecf8cae680f0bde6c0b7bdaec348ef9be554) (460 days - high activity; ENS tag -> tangiblelabs.eth)
    * [Signer 2](https://debank.com/profile/0xff7afa1153c4d56756000b29ff534f309129ac26) (558 days - medium activity)
    * [Signer 3](https://debank.com/profile/0x6bd40c6f7849160fe217d07a73e15f4ef8222283) (428 days - low activity)
    * [Signer 4](https://debank.com/profile/0xfbce8758dbf56d574a80fa3a6ab27275a8f1ef6a) (306 days - no activity)
    * [Signer 5](https://debank.com/profile/0xd5c77e6a29a09324b0b0d1bc813beaeabc3b0b6c) (306 days - no activity)
* [USDR Treasury Manager](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x5F5b6597a5AC0d87FEff2e6757668885239ff3d2#code) Multi-sig (3-of-5)
    * The same five signers as for the wallet above (Tangible DAO Msg)

In summary, the first three signers are the same for all three wallets. The other two that complete the 4-of-5 and 3-of-5 multi-sigs have no activity. This leads to the conclusion that all multi-sigs, and thus the entire protocol is controlled via three EOAs, whereby tangiblelabs.eth (signer 1) is the one setting the tone.

Another example is the [marketplace fee distributor](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x49c7371DAecB7f06fC7303A14ab80174453dF4cF#code). This contract is used to distribute 66.6% of the fees and swap the remaining 33.3% on Uniswap, to buy and burn TNGBL. This contract is controlled by one single [EOA](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9e9d5307451d11b2a9f84d9cfd853327f2b7e0f7). The same is true for the [Tangible:Deployer](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xd71b43474da7f77a567925f107f5fa611a22cb40?a=0x3d41487a3c5662ede90d0ee8854f3cc59e8d66ad) contract, which controls 78% of all 3,3+ NFTs.

In other words, there is a high trust factor for all assets in Tangible’s smart contract custody. One person controls the fee distribution, which should ideally be automated or be callable by a public function. The collateral in the USDR treasury is also accessible by the Tangible Labs multi-sig. So are almost all smart contracts. Leading to the conclusion that the current custody setup is highly risky, not trustless, and prone to errors.


## Off-Chain (RWA) Custody Risk

As indicated earlier, having real estate as collateral for a stablecoin comes with some benefits, but also with several risks. The main risks are summarised below:



* **Off-chain Custody** - RE as collateral requires trusted custody of the legal ownership within an SPV. The SPVs and the on-chain equivalents are controlled by Tangible Custody LTD.
* **Legality and regulatory compliance** - Given the lack of regulatory guidance, it is unclear if and how the current setup is regulatory compliant. This can be said over most crypto projects, however, this case is even more relevant as it has an impact on the real world, incl. tenants and local communities.
* **Conflict of Interest** - Having the same company that is issuing USDR also controlling the on- and off-ramp of the RWA’s backing the stablecoin can lead to conflicts of interest. It also adds a centralized single point of failure and it raises the question of scalability.
* **Evaluation of Real Estate** - Evaluating the collateral value of RE is a complicated process. The support offered by websites such as [hometrack](https://www.hometrack.com/) or [zoopla](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/) is a decent start, but these are just [estimates](https://www.hometrack.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Your-Hometrack-Property-Valuation-Report-for-SE1-2LH.pdf). They can’t predict the liquidation value. Besides, hometrack is not usable for free, thus limiting accessibility (it costs £20 per [valuation](https://www.hometrack.com/products/opportunity-insight/property-valuation-report/)). Zoopla on the other hand is free to use.

Risks associated with the last two points become apparent when looking at an example. Using the same property as in the previous chapter, Zoopla comes up with a [price](https://www.zoopla.co.uk/for-sale/property/chatham/gillingham-gate-road/?q=S1-08%20Chatham%20Waters%2C%20South%20House%2C%20Gillingham%20Gate%20Rd%2C%20Gillingham%20ME4%204RS%2C%20UK&search_source=home) between £370k–390k ($457k–482k). This is for a property similar to the apartment in [Gillingham](https://www.tangible.store/product/0x29613FbD3e695a669C647597CEFd60bA255cc1F8?tokenId=340282366920938463463374607431768211474) mentioned above. In comparison, Tangible values the Gillingham property at $529k USDR. A difference of plus 9–15%. Thus allowing for a higher issuance of USDR, which might not be fully backed if push comes to shove. According to the team, their valuation also includes other funds held in the RE reserve (e.g. 5% maintenance fee, 2% vacancy fee, 2% management fee, etc). Nonetheless, this example emphasizes the conflict of interest that occurs when the same protocol issues the stablecoin and the collateral backing it. Naturally Tangible is incentivized to apply a high evaluation.

Tangible is working on a solution to this problem. A collaboration with Chainlink should allow an independent oracle price feed for all Tangibles real estate TNFTs (more in the following section).


## Oracle Risk

Tangible implemented a fingerprint oracle solution for pricing its RWAs TNFTs. A fingerprint oracle uses a unique ID assigned to each product (product_id = a string representing a unique item). This way, Tangible can map each item to its market price, provided by their suppliers. Fingerprints are assigned to products before the TNFT is minted, and token IDs are mapped to the fingerprint after minting. This solution is also chosen because it fits within the limited block size of the Polygon sidechain.

In summary, Tangible uses a custom oracle solution. This allows them to inform the prices of their traded goods. Some details were also provided in the [Curve Gauge Proposal](https://gov.curve.fi/t/proposal-to-add-usdr-am3crv-to-the-curve-gauge-controller-polygon/8981): “_We have our own oracles for properties at the moment but are working with Chainlink to integrate, then true property valuations via 3rd party [Hometrack.com](http://hometrack.com/) can be reflected on a chain in Real Time so the treasury values and the collateralization ratio are up to date, this also allows for “minting on gains” to work more effectively in real-time._”

A collaboration with Chainlink sounds promising. This would take the price definition out of Tangible’s influence. This removes the “conflict of interest” mentioned above. However, using only hometrack as the only price source moves the question of reliability to another single entity. While it’s definitely an improvement, it can’t guarantee that the oracle sources the actual liquidation price.


## Governance Risk

As of writing this report, Tangible has not introduced any elements of decentralized governance. The project is centrally steered and developed by the founding team. There are no structures for the community to get involved or facilitate decentralized decision-making (i.e. no dedicated Discord channel, no forum, no governance constitution, or voting tools). The risks related to centralized governance, custody, and management were mentioned in the sections above.


## Depeg Risk

Since its inception, USDR has been relatively stable. The only mentionable depeg happened during the weekend of March 11/12, 2023. The same weekend that USDC lost its peg. USDR is partially backed by DAI (~25%), which itself is mostly backed by USDC ([~63%](https://dune.com/SebVentures/maker---accounting_1)).

However, with regard to USDR’s stability, the price has been mostly around the one Dollar mark. It also recovered quickly from the depeg in mid of March (see image below).

![coingecko-usdr-price](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/coingecko-usdr-price-chart.png)


(Source: [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/real-usd))

The following stability mechanisms are installed to keep USDR at peg:



* As a first measure to prevent depegs, USDR is redeemable for the DAI that is backing it. Currently, around 25% of its collateral is denominated in DAI.
* As a second measure, USDR is backed by protocol-owned liquidity, consisting of the USDR Curve [pool](https://curve.fi/#/polygon/pools/factory-v2-339/deposit). In combination, the two measures guarantee a certain amount of liquidity for trading or redeeming USDR.
* As a third step, Tangible established an insurance fund. At the time of writing, the insurance fund stands at ~$1.1M (9.2%) of USDRs collateral. However, the Polygon-based [multi-sig](https://debank.com/profile/0xd1758fbabae91c805be76d56548a584ef68b81f0) mainly contains 20/80 USDC/TNGBL LP tokens. In other words, the insurance fund mostly consists of more TNGBL.
* As mentioned earlier, Tangible also aims to implement [pDAI](https://docs.tangible.store/real-usd/redeeming-real-usd) (i.e. promissory DAI). pDAI would be required in the case of a bank run, meaning that Tangible has to sell its RE TNFTs, to make USDR holders whole. In such a scenario, pDAI would be redeemable instead of DAI. And once enough real estate is liquidated, pDAI holders can swap it for real DAI.

Given that pDAI has not been implemented yet, the stability of USDR relies on the first three mechanisms. Furthermore, USDR is available cross-chain, which needs to be considered as well when looking at the peg stability. To use its stablecoin outside of Polygon, Tangible created wrapped USDR (wUSDR).


### wUSDR

Real USD can be wrapped into wUSDR through Tangible’s [website](https://www.tangible.store/realusd?action=Wrap). Wrapping is done on [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xaf0d9d65fc54de245cda37af3d18cbec860a4d4b). From there, it can be transferred to [BSC](https://bscscan.com/token/0x2952beb1326accbb5243725bd4da2fc937bca087), [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x340fe1d898eccaad394e2ba0fc1f93d27c7b717a), [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd5a14081a34d256711b02bbef17e567da48e80b5), and [Arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xddc0385169797937066bbd8ef409b5b3c0dfeb52) using Multichain’s router. wUSDR holders can then provide liquidity and farm on different DEX and yield aggregators across these ecosystems. For instance, [Beefy](https://app.beefy.com/vault/velodrome-wusdr-usdc) and [Velodrome](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x48dce63bacf1c7c839cfa7d4f871ad17c0d30d38) (Optimism), [Thena](https://info.thena.fi/token/0x2952beb1326accbb5243725bd4da2fc937bca087) (BSC), or [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x831261f44931b7da8ba0dcc547223c60bb75b47f000200000000000000000460) and [Aura](https://etherscan.io/address/0x831261f44931b7da8ba0dcc547223c60bb75b47f) (Ethereum). Farming on Arbitrum isn't enabled yet.

In order to be compatible with Multichain’s router as a “bridge asset”, wUSDR implemented Multichain’s extension smart contract Anyswapv6ERC20.sol. This creates a better user experience when transferring wUSDR to mentioned chains. However, as highlighted in our previous [report](https://cryptorisks.substack.com/p/cross-chain-gauges-and-ecosystem) about Multichain, this hands over the control for the wUSDR mint and burn functions to Multichain’s MPC. Thus adding an additional element of dependency and risk to USDR and wUSDR.

Moreover, there is a big difference between wUSDR and USDR. The wrapped version of the token does not rebase. Instead, it increases in price when the rental distribution occurs. Hence, there is a difference between the price of wUSDR and USDR (see the image below).


![wrapped-usdr](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/tangible-website-wrap-usdr.png)


(Source: Tangible [website](https://www.tangible.store/realusd?action=Wrap))

With a constantly increasing price, these liquidity pools are not “pure stable pools". They can not be considered to meaningfully contribute to USDRs pegging mechanism. On the contrary, adding more complexity to a project that is already a handful. It’s also worth pointing out that there is a high concentration in terms of wUSDR token holders. On all chains outside of Polygon, almost all wUSDR tokens are deposited into the above-mentioned DEXs (see image below).

![wusdr-cross-chain-implementation](https://github.com/Lavi54/protocol-research-review/blob/1df338393309656066ae5438633ead36570d1477/articles/TangibleDAO/images/usdr-crosschain-implementation.png)


In conclusion, Tangible has built several mechanisms that support the peg of USDR. And they conceptualized a promising method (pDAI), to assure that USDR holders can always redeem USDR for something of equal value. However, most measures are still new, and not battle-tested, and some are fully centralized (e.g. real estate liquidations). Especially in the case of a bank run, it's questionable whether USDR can hold its peg. Moreover, the project introduced multiple dimensions of additional complexity and potential weaknesses through its wUSDR token and Multichain integration. These factors do not contribute to the safety of USDR’s peg stability. Nonetheless, USDR has so far proven to be quite stable and survived its first depeg well.


# Discussion



1. **Is it possible for one single entity to rug its users?**

Yes, Tangible can neglect to liquidate assets or not honor redemptions. In addition, most of the protocol’s funds, including its treasury, insurance funds, and collateral assets in smart contract custody, can be accessed by the same two or three multi-sig signers. The same is obviously true for all real-world assets, and for all smart contracts. Moreover, there are no time locks.

These are clearly some red flags. The fact that the [team](https://docs.tangible.store/legal#who-is-on-the-tangible-labs-team) is public and is experienced in building Web3 start-ups, adds some credibility. However, only two signers need to be compromised to endanger the whole project and user funds.



2. **If the team vanishes, can the project continue?**

No, the team controls all contracts, assets, and custody of all RWAs. If the team vanishes, the DAO could not exercise the liquidation of its RWAs. Moreover, nobody could update the contracts, distribute fees, or access any other assets held in the treasury. Hence, it’s unlikely that the real estate properties or any other RWAs in Tangible’s custody can be accessed by anyone outside the team.

The team mentioned the objective to partner with other RE issuers, to reduce dependency on their own LLC. This, however, is not the case yet.



3. **Does the protocol rely on CRV or other incentives to keep its peg?**

Not at this point. USDR has grown to a market cap of [$11.5M](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/real-usd) around the time of writing. USDR has also been relatively stable. The only depeg occurred during the depeg of USDC, whereby most stablecoins experience some issues over the course of one weekend. USDR has quickly recovered and remained stable since.

Given that they have not profited from CRV rewards so far, this leads to the conclusion that these rewards are not needed to keep USDR at the peg.



4. **Do audits reveal any concerning signs?**

No, the first audit did not find any severe issues. However, there has only been one audit so far. A second audit is underway while this report is being written. It is worth noting that there is no active bounty program, and generally Tangible and USDR is still a young project.

As mentioned above, there seem to be some architectural inconsistencies and a missing smart contract business logic, that is relying on a role-based system. Currently, Tangible is more a company than a protocol, leaving room for human errors that can be implemented undetected.


# Conclusion

Tangible is a very ambitious and fast-moving project. It introduces novel RWA use cases and an innovative stablecoin with intrinsic yield and a rebase mechanism. The concepts with regard to RWA trading, and real estate as collateral are sound and often well thought through. One conceptual flaw, however, is that the protocol represents the issuer and collateral taker of RE TNFTs. Additionally, the actual implementation of the project's vision often leaves room for improvement. Tangible is prioritizing growth and fast releases of new features over the improvement and decentralization of the existing infrastructure.

The entire setup related to smart contract custody, RWA custody, governance, and USDR peg stability is insufficient and urges caution. The protocol is susceptible to human errors and requires complete trust in the entities behind the platform. Moreover, it’s quite complex on a technical and conceptual level, and a lot could be done to improve the project’s transparency (e.g. multi-sig setup, ownership and custody of RWAs, pricing of RWAs, cross-chain wUSDR implementation, roadmap, access rights, admin roles, and hidden owners, just to name a few keywords).

In summary, the project is a pioneer in the RE/RWA-backed stablecoin market. But it is somewhat opaque and the visible elements come with several risks. The project is not of decentralized nature.
