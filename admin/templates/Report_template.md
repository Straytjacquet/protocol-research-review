- Governance (Multisig address, gov contract, gov reference)
- Market Data (Curve pool, analytics)


## TLDR 
(Short explanation about the protocol's relation to Curve and reasons for conducting this report)
(Short explanation of most important finding from the research. Include the most noteworthy risk factors here)


# [Protocol Name] Introduction 
(Overview of how the protocol works including any and all things relevant to the thesis)
- History (how long has it been around, has it undergone significant changes in its lifespan, does it have any previous hacks or blights on its reputation?)
- Governance asset (If and how is it incorporated into the protocol)
- Stablecoin/pegged asset (what are the mechanisms)
- Market (where is it traded, CEX & DEX, and what's the historical behavior/level of adoption? Analyze Curve pool in relation to broader market)


# Risk Vectors
(Introduce the relevant risk vectors. Typical vectors listed as sections below, but modify to suit the findings from your research.)

## Smart Contract Risk

## Custody Risk

## Oracle Risk

## Depeg Risk

## Collateral Risk


# LlamaRisk Gauge Criteria
(An analysis of all the above findings are used to answer the following questions, which we ultimately use to determine whether we recommend a gauge or not)

Centralization Factors
1. Is it possible for a single entity to rug its users?
2. If the team vanishes, can the project continue?

Economic Factors
1. Does the project's viability depend on additional incentives?
2. If demand falls to 0 tomorrow, can all users be made whole?

Security Factors
1. Do audits reveal any concerning signs?


# Risk Team Recommendation
(Don't worry about this section in the first draft, we will discuss together and with the protocol team to determine our final recommendation)
